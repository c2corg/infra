# haproxy ingress

There appears to be two ingress controller implementations for haproxy:

- <https://github.com/haproxytech/helm-charts/tree/main/kubernetes-ingress>
- <https://github.com/jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress>

We use the one from haproxytech here, since it seems to be the "official" implementation.
